# Introduction

Estimate gets you through poker planning fast so you can spend less time in meetings. We want to make remote poker planning shorter and less frustrating. To achieve this, we built Estimate with three core values in mind.

**Simplicity**

Starting a scoring session takes only two steps: 1. Pick a sprint to score; 2. Start scoring. The tool aims to limit choices around the scoring process to enable focus on the scored work. 

**Speed**

Visual cues and clear state transitions build momentum and finish sprint planning faster. We aim to build features that prevent context switching. One example is the ability to comment on a work item straight from Estimate.

**Opinionated**

A welcoming, but guided experience helps your team adopt best practices and onboard new teammates fast.
